## Cracking the Coding Interview
A great starting point, goes over every topic you might need to know for interviews

## Grokking Algorithms
A brief, unintimidating level algo textbook. Best illustrations

## Algorithm Design [KT], Intro to Algo [CLRS]
These are the textbooks used in an Algo class. They are somewhat advanced, but thorough

## Intro to Competitive Programming
Covers a lot of the same stuff as the algo textbooks, but with C++ code samples and less emphasis on proofs (and no exercises)

## Interview Guide
Shamelessly stolen from some career services somewhere, goes over the less critical, but not trivial, non-technical aspects of interviews
